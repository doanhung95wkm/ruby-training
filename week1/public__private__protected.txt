Private, Public, Protected methods

    A private method can't be called outside the class.

    A public method can be called everywhere.

    A protected method can be called outside the class, but it has to be called through another public method. 

    class Box
       # constructor method
       def initialize(w,h)
          @width, @height = w, h
       end

       # instance method by default it is public
       def getArea
          getWidth() * getHeight
            self.printArea
       end

       # define private accessor methods
       def getWidth
          @width
       end
       def getHeight
          @height
       end
       # make them private
       private :getWidth, :getHeight

       # instance method to print area
       def printArea
          @area = getWidth * getHeight
          puts "Big box area is : #@area"
       end
       # make it protected
       protected :printArea
    end

    # create an object
    box = Box.new(10, 20)

    # call instance methods
    box.getArea()
